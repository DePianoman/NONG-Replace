# NONG-Replace

Allows an easy way to replace levels' songs with their respective NONG songs.

## NOTE: THIS REQUIRES MEGA HACK V6!!

If you do not have it, this mod will not function!

Put the mod in your `extensions` folder and start the game up!

There should be an option to replace the songs in MegaHack under the NONG Replace section. Enable that and have fun!

If you need to submit any levels to be added then you can either use the button in Mega Hack or use [this link](https://forms.gle/sjpXjvuCUmC2zGqw7)!
